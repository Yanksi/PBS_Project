* Demos
    * Solid-Solid interaction (cube and sphere, Not working very well)
    * 2 phase liquid interaction
    * Liquid-Solid interaction
* Current problems
    * instability during liquid-solid interaction
    * initial situation (extremly unstable)
    * Fixes that have been applied
        * weighted solid particle contribution to the density function
        * updates are divided by the number of contact solver iterations, to make the updates to be as small as possible.
* Final scene
    2 Liquids + 2 objs
